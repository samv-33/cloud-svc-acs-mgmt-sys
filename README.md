Create a new Connection, and name it anything you like:

I named mines "cloud_access_management"

Create a Database, we used "my_database" for the name. I would recommend using this name
to be consistent with the configurations on our models.py file

Also create each collection accordingly to our collection names in models.py for efficiency
So like (users_collection, )

# Instructions to setup Database with MongoDB Compass

Download latest version of MongoDB Compass or MongoDB shell from the official website

Create a new Connection, and name it anything you like:

I named mine "cloud_access_management"

Create a Database, we used "my_database" for the name. I would recommend using this name
to be consistent with the configurations on our models.py file

Also create each collection accordingly to our collection names in models.py for efficiency
So like (users_collection, sub_plan_collection, etc.)

We used an .env file, so you could just rename ".env.sample" to .env and use the db information
provided. Unless the localhost url is different then you could change it to the localhost url provided
by your database settings in Mongodb. 

MongoDB Compass should provide the local mongo url.

# Instructions to setup Database with MongoDB Atlas

create a new ".env" file

Log into MongoDB and create a new cluster

add your URL given into your .env file as "MONGO_URI"

# Testing

with the server running in one terminal, navigate to localhost:8000/docs to test using swagger

Or Log into Postman if you would like to test it there as well:

# POSTMAN INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Base URL
Make sure your FastAPI server is running. By default, it should be accessible at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
All the Object IDs and other IDs will be in the Database available to copy and paste
for reuse on each API endpoint.

2. General Steps
Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the URL for the endpoint.
Add required headers, body, and parameters as described below for each endpoint.
Click Send to execute the request.
Review the response in Postman.
